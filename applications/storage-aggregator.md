# Project Description

An API for unified storage, billions of possibilities!

Storage Aggregator provides a unified storage API, making it easier to retrieve and store billions of blockchain data!

Storage Aggregator provides you with dozens of custom storage platforms and intelligent file retrieval services!

Storage Aggregator Personal Web3 Storage in a Decentralized Web!

The Storage Aggregator Network is a great decentralized storage network built on Substrate that allows anyone participating in storage to receive fair rewards from the protocol!
`SA` is built on Substrate, provides a native cross-chain communication tray based on SCMP (Cross-Chain Message Passing), and stores it in the SA storage cloud through a unified data exchange API that is 100% compatible with **Amazon S3 API** and Retrieve user data. 
This allows any project to use any AWS library or SDK and start using our system without extensive integration work.

The Storage Aggregator ecosystem has three types of nodes: file nodes provide file upload/download services, gateway nodes work directly with the decentralized cloud, and billing nodes calculate storage costs and charge users.
Due to ETH's high transaction price and latency, we use **Polkadot parachain** for transaction billing (per data storage/retrieval operation)
### NFT support

- Built-in option to tag any uploaded file
- Use ERC-721 or ERC-1115 NFT standard
- Universal digital asset storage for any NFT marketplace

### Designed for Defi

- Transparent, immutable and cryptographically verifiable
- Large mixed datasets (like payment schedules and token binding curves)
- Web3-based "all-in-one" experience for unified data management

### Hot and cold data

- Smart selection for "cold" & "hot" data based on data type
- "Cold" data is rarely used, but must be kept long-term or even permanently; "Hot" data is used frequently and may update deleted data
- Dozens of times cheaper and faster than normal storage like Amazon Clouds

### Full granular visibility

- Storage Aggregator has indexed and decoded major storage platforms to facilitate data storage and retrieval through a unified API: make it available to developers anytime, anywhere. Provides convenience for storing data on billions of blockchains.
- Switch between Storage Aggregators without data migration

### Supports multiple storage platforms

- Works with multiple storage platforms (Amazon Glacier, Google Coldline, IPFS, Swarm,

  Simple and seamless integration of Filecoin, storj, arweave, SIQ, 0CHAIN, Lambad, BitTorrent, Alibaba Cloud, etc.)

- Developers use Storage Aggregator to reduce time to market from 2 weeks to a few hours.

### Use Case Marketplace

- Developers can create their own API endpoints for their projects and list them on the marketplace for others to use.

### No-code solution

- Storage Aggregator does not require developers to write indexing code or understand the nuances of storage platform interfaces. Also accessible to non-technical users.

### Primer conversion engine

- An internal transformation language inspired by the MongoDB query language. Using Primer, developers can select only the fields they want and further aggregate the data to meet their needs. All of this is done on the fly at query time.

### Decentralized index query middleware

- The Storage Aggregator network has fully decentralized storage and computation layers with low fees and high throughput.

## Value

The Storage Aggregator ecosystem has three types of nodes: file nodes provide file upload/download services, gateway nodes work directly with the decentralized cloud, and billing nodes calculate storage costs and charge users. Regarding storage fees, we use Storage Aggregator network tokens, Fil, USDC, etc. for transaction billing (per data storage/retrieval operation)

We have our own storage miner node. We need a large amount of real data storage to replace the 0 data encapsulated in the sector, and through the aggregator, we can obtain more real data to improve the computing power of the node.

Blockchain offers a new frontier of development for businesses, consumers and software developers. Due to its decentralized architecture, immutable ledger and highly secure framework, the application of this technology will impact industries from finance and retail to personal identity and cryptocurrencies. Storage Aggregator provides a unified API to store billions of blockchain data Bring convenience!

Storage Aggregator is an open source project funded by DDS (Decentralized Data Systems Foundation). Storage Aggregator is being actively developed and maintained by a global development team, governed entirely by community proposal voting, empowering future pioneers by providing the richest and most powerful data storage infrastructure for the entire blockchain ecosystem
## Deliverables

We will deliver the following software and documentation artifacts in the scope of this grant application.

- Storage Aggregator official website.
- Storage Aggregator Blockchain Network.
- Provide a unified API to index and decode mainstream storage platforms.
- Primer Transformation Engine, an internal transformation language inspired by the MongoDB query language. Using Primer, developers can select only the fields they want and further aggregate the data to meet their needs. All of this is done on the fly at query time
- Provides a fully decentralized storage and computing layer with low fees and high throughput.
- NFT & Defi support
- Documentation. Tutorials for node operators and developers, as well as contributor guides.

## Total Budget Requested

Due to the heavy workload, it is necessary to mobilize engineers in and out of the project to keep the progress in sync with the upstream storage platform progress, and the diverse skills required (12 people x month full-time GO/Rust/blockchain engineer/front-end engineer/product manager/UI design ), we are requesting a 90,000 DAI Foundation grant. All funds will be used to cover personnel costs, including wages, taxes, insurance, benefits. The important thing is that we need to buy some machines to deploy the service and we are willing to pay part of the budget in DAI.

We can invoice based on completed milestones.

- Phase 1: 15,000 DAI
- Phase 2: 25,000 DAI
- Phase 3: 20,000 DAI
- Phase 4: 20,000 DAI
- Phase 5: 10,000 DAI

Total :90,000 DAI

## Maintenance and Upgrade Plans

Our team is committed to maintaining the maintenance, upgrade and operation of the Storage Aggregator network; in the later stage, based on user feedback, we will improve our project, and the team will open source and maintain the development code for at least three years.
